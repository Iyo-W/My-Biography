              Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Iyosias, and I am a
              beginner full-stack developer who is just starting my journey into
              web development. I created this page to introduce myself, share
              what I am learning, and showcase some of the projects I have
              worked on so far.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently learning the basics of front-end and back-end
              development, including how websites are structured and how they
              function. I enjoy practicing my skills by building small projects
              and improving them as I learn new concepts.

            <p>
              This project is a simple webpage that introduces who I am and
              provides basic information about my background and interests. It
              includes sections such as an “About Me” area and a short
              description of my learning goals. Through this project, I
              practiced writing basic HTML, organizing content into sections,
              and applying simple styling to improve readability.

            <p>
              This project is a beginner portfolio website designed to display
              my projects in one place. It includes a welcome section, a
              projects section, and basic layout styling. Working on this
              project helped me understand how to structure a webpage, use CSS
              for styling, and create a layout that is easy to navigate.

            <p>
              This project is a basic to-do list app that allows users to add
              tasks and remove them when completed. It focuses on simple user
              interaction and functionality. This project helped me learn the
              basics of JavaScript, including handling user input and updating
              content on the page dynamically.
